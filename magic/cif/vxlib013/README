# The layout has been written from Magic using the command
# ;cif ostyle lambda=0.055um(vsclib)
# ;cif write cell_name
# from within Magic.
# The layout contains both separate ndif and pdif layers for the
# diffusion, and a single activ layer for the diffusion with
# implant layers NIMP and PIMP. The geometries are cleaner than
# the layout written from Alliance.
